#When dealing with finite populations in statistics, 
#it is common to approximate the population as infinite 
#if the sample size (n) is much smaller than the population size (N), 
#specifically when the ratio n/N is less than 0.05. 
#This approximation is known as the "finite population correction" or "FPC,"
